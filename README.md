Here's my first try to make an ONLINE SHOP WEBSITE - using React Library

Github-pages

What is done by the moment: 

SHOPPING CART
  1. Delete btn
  2. Total cost counting
  3. Products displaying

PRODUCTS
  1. Add to Cart Btn
  2. Scaling by clicking on the image (modal window)
  3. Backdrop
  4. Filter by categories
